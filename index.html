   <p>To help you choose where to ski this weekend, this app calculates the top 5 options with the most forecasted powder for the least amount of drive time. When you click "See the best mountains" the app calcualtes a "Trip Appeal Score" (a term I made up that equals snowfall divided by drive-time) for each of the largest 19 mountains in the Northeast . Drive time is determined by average drive time from NYC to the mountain. Forecasted snowfall shows snowfall expected in the next 3 days (so you can plan for the weekend). </p>


  <p>In future versions we hope to include mountains outside the Northeast, use your current location to calculate drive time, and add average liftline wait times. </p>
