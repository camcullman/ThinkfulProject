Where's the Powder?

This site was created to help get you on the ski mountain. To develop and refine the app's design, primary research in the form of interviews and surveys, as well as secondary research of other skiing resources, was conducted. 

During this research, we learned that one of the biggest hurdles skiers and snowboarders face is simply choosing the right place to ski. An online search of where to ski causes a faceful of information overload - hundreds of sites giving different recomendations based on dozens of factors. With skiers already short on time because they are planning a last minute trip, simplifying this choice is key. 

This is why "WheresThePowder" was created - to simplify the decision about where to ski to the most important factors. How much snow will it have and how far a drive is it.

In order to give top recomendations and stay unbiased (we all have a favorite ski spot), the app calculates a very simple formula for each mountain: expected snowfall for the next 3 days / average drive time. It then spits out the top 5 spots with the most snow for the shortest drive. 

To calculate the distance, the app currently assumes skiers are in the New York City area and uses average drive times to each location. To calculate snowfall, it uses data from www.worldweatheronline.com's Ski weather API - which allows us to pull expected snowfall for the next 3 days - the ideal time before deciding to go on a last minute ski trip late in the work week. 

This is currently a beta version of the site. In the future, we're exploring adding the ability to seach only for your favorite mountain. Primary research showed that many skiers already have a resort or two in mind when choosing where to ski. Some have a house they normally ski at and their question is whether it's worth it to make the trip to that specific resort.  

If you have any feedback on the site, positive or negative, please feel free to send it to me at cameron.cullman@gmail.com. I'm always looking to make the site better and easier to use.

We hope you enjoy the app and that it gets you on the mountain more often and easily. And maybe it will even help you discover a new favorite spot to ski.

Happy Skiing,
